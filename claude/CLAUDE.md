# Response Style
- When answering questions, always recommend best practices and present alternative options
- `git push` is not permitted; always ask the user to push when needed
- When creating new text in external tools (e.g., Linear, Notion, GitHub), detect the language already used in that context and write in the same language
- Do not copy the user's wording verbatim; always rewrite in a concise, technical tone
